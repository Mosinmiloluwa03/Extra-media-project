  <h1>The difference between the pacific and atlantic ocean</h1> 
  <p>The Pacific Ocean, bordering San Diego, is the largest and deepest ocean in the world, covering more than 63 million square miles. In contrast, the Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, with an area of about 41 million square miles. The Pacific stretches from the west coast of the Americas to Asia and Australia, while the Atlantic lies between the east coast of the Americas and Europe and Africa.
    Water Temperature and Climate
    
    One of the most noticeable differences for surfers is water temperature. The Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego tends to have cooler waters, especially influenced by the California Current, which brings cold water from the north. The Atlantic Ocean, particularly along the eastern United States, is warmer, influenced by the Gulf Stream that carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico up the coast.</p>
